# maze_solver

## Idea
The idea of this AI is to be able to solve a map no matter what dimesions and positions it has (except the absolut impossible ones). It uses a vanilla Q learning algorithm to solve each map in an optimal way.

## Installation

To install this AI you need to have the following requiremenets:

- Python 3.*
- Pygame 2.0.0
- Numpy 1.20.1
- Matplotlib 3.4.3

## How to use it.

You simply have to run main.py and add the map you want the AI to train, and it also comes with a map creator (create_maps.py) this is how you use it:

First you run the file and add the name of the map, then you use the left button to of your mouse to create walls and the right one to delete them. If you want to edit the map even more you can change the sizes and the positions of each object by editing the file in specific variables (python knowledge is required).
